lu5's goal is to make coding accessible by exposing simple lua bindings for graphics, math, and various common operations.

### Adding functions

The bindings can be found in `./src/bindings/*.h` and they need to be registered in `./src/lu5_bindings.c` to add them to the lua State

Add a documentation comment for each lua binding.

<br/>

### Adding global variables

If you want to add a global variable that will not change (constant), you might want to add it in `./src/lu5_bindings.c` in `lu5_register_constants`.

If you want to update variables (ex: `mouseX`, `mouseY`) add them in `lu5_update_dynamic_variables`, this will update them after every `draw` call
